# üîí KeyQuest Security Checklist

Use this checklist before publishing to GitHub or deploying to production.

## üìã Pre-Publication Checklist

- [ ] Database queries use parameterized statements (Supabase client)
- [ ] No direct SQL string concatenation
- [ ] Input validation before database operations
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

### ‚úÖ Dependencies & Code Quality
- [ ] `npm audit` shows no high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] ESLint passes without security-related warnings
- [ ] No unused dependencies in package.json
- [ ] Dependabot is configured for automatic updates

### ‚úÖ CI/CD Security
- [ ] GitHub Actions security workflow is configured
- [ ] CodeQL analysis is enabled
- [ ] Secret scanning is active
- [ ] Dependency review is configured for PRs
- [ ] Build process doesn't expose secrets

## üö® Emergency Response

If secrets were accidentally committed:

### Immediate Actions (within 1 hour)
1. **Stop all deployments** using the compromised secrets
2. **Rotate all affected credentials** immediately
3. **Run the cleanup script**: `npm run security:cleanup`
4. **Force push cleaned history**: `git push --force-with-lease`
5. **Update all deployment environments** with new secrets

### Follow-up Actions (within 24 hours)
1. **Monitor access logs** for unauthorized usage
2. **Notify team members** to re-clone the repository
3. **Review and update** security procedures
4. **Document the incident** for future prevention

## üîç Security Testing Commands

Run these commands before publishing:

```bash
# 1. Lint and security audit
npm run security:check

# 2. Check for secrets in git history
git log --name-only --pretty=format: | grep -E '\.(env|key|pem)$'

# 3. Scan for hardcoded secrets (if TruffleHog is installed)
npx @trufflesecurity/trufflehog filesystem .

# 4. Test build process
npm run build

# 5. Check bundle size
ls -lh build/static/js/
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Production Deployment Checklist

### ‚úÖ Hosting Configuration
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced (HTTP redirects to HTTPS)
- [ ] Security headers are configured in hosting platform
- [ ] CORS is configured for specific origins only
- [ ] CDN security features are enabled
- [ ] Error pages don't leak sensitive information

### ‚úÖ Environment Variables
- [ ] All required environment variables are set in production
- [ ] No development/test credentials in production
- [ ] Environment variables are properly scoped
- [ ] Backup of environment configuration exists

### ‚úÖ Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Error monitoring is configured (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Access logs are monitored
- [ ] Security alerts are configured
- [ ] Incident response procedures are documented

### ‚úÖ Supabase Production Setup
- [ ] Production Supabase project is separate from development
- [ ] RLS policies are tested and working
- [ ] API keys are production-specific
- [ ] Database backups are configured
- [ ] Access monitoring is enabled

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

Before pushing to GitHub:

```bash
# 1. Run full security check
npm run security:check

# 2. Verify no secrets in git history
./scripts/cleanup-secrets.sh

# 3. Test build with production-like environment
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co \
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=example_key \
npm run build

# 4. Check that .env.local is ignored
git status --ignored | grep .env.local

# 5. Verify security headers configuration
cat public/_headers
```
